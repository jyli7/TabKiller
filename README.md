### what it is

Too many tabs? Kill them in three different ways.

Sniper: Enter a sequence of characters, e.g. "goog." The sniper will kill all tabs whose titles match your input. Thus, if you enter "goog," tabs titled "Google," "Google Maps," "Google extensions," etc. will be killed. 

Bunker: The bunker is the inverse of the sniper. It will kill all tabs *except* for those whose titles match your input (they have been placed into the bunker).

Cannon: The cannon kills a range of tabs. If you enter "1-4," for example, you'll kill the first tab through the fourth tab (inclusive).
