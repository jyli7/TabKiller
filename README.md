### How to use Tab Killer

Too many tabs? Tab Killer gives you three different ways to kill them. 

**Sniper**: Title match/kill. 
Enter a sequence of characters, e.g. "goog." The sniper will kill all tabs whose titles partially match your input. Thus, if you enter "goog," any tabs containing "goog" in their title (e.g. "Google") will be killed. 

If you want to the sniper to take down multiple tabs, separate your inputs with a comma, e.g. "goo, foo, bar."

*Note:* The sniper is only as discriminating as you order it to be! If you type in "a" and all of your tabs have "a" somewhere in their titles, the sniper will kill them all!

**Bunker**: Title match/protect. Kill everything else. 
The bunker is the inverse of the sniper. It will kill all tabs *except* for those whose titles partially match your input (as they have been placed into the bunker).

If you want to protect multiple tabs, separate your inputs with a comma, e.g. "goo, foo, bar."

**Cannon**: Range kill.
The cannon kills a range of tabs. If you enter "1-4," for example, you'll kill the first tab through the fourth tab (inclusive).
*Note*: The first tab is 1, not 0.
